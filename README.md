# Glasses Detection via OpenCV

Right now all it does is detect and mask reflections in glasses. Edge detection is planned next-up, if the time allows.

To use, run the program with `python main.py <file-to-process>`

The program should handle most ocular images. For best results, use 4:3 ratio images, as the program scales them to 320x240 resolution.
